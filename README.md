# Brandon
A randomized to do list to worry less about making lists and start doing stuff.

# So, what is Brandon?
Brandon is a "no-list to do list", where you enter your chores and the program chooses one at random for you to do, right now.
The goal of Brandon is to reduce the anxiety of having to do a to do list in the first place.

# Why was Brandon created?
Because its creator hates to do lists. One day he woke up and he had the idea of a randomized to do list, so he grabbed his poor skills in programming and made this thing.

# In what language is Brandon coded?
Python 3.7. The executable build is made possible by pyinstaller 4.1, made by Hartmut Goebel, Giovanni Bajo, David Vierra, David Cortesi, and Martin Zibricky.

# Is the creator of Brandon a Computer Scientist or known Programmer?
Not in the slightest. This is his second proof-of-concept in Python, a language he barely knows (and it shows).

# In what language is Brandon available?
Currently, just in Spanish. You may know about it, it's the second most used language in the world.

# Where can I make suggestions for Brandon?
HMU in Twitter, at @homeworld.
